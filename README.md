PatchIt!
========

This is the readme to **PatchIt!**, a [Python 3](http://www.python.org) application written by Triangle717 to be the standard and simple way to
packaging and install mods for the 1999 High Voltage Software PC game *LEGO Racers*.

The Plan
--------

Although *LEGO Racers* modding is still in it's early stages, many mods are already being developed, and there 
needs to be a standard way to install them. Heavily influenced and based on **Patchman!**, a mod installer for 
the 1999 Data Design Interactive PC game *LEGO Rock Raiders*, **PatchIt!** aims to be a standard and simple way 
to install *LEGO Racers* mods.

How It Works
------------

The three main goals for **PatchIt!** are as follows:

* Ask for the *LEGO Racers* installation, ensure one exists at that location, and store it as a plain text file in the same folder as **PatchIt!** to be used 
as the mod installation directory, and to create a completely portable (thumb-drive) application.
* Create a **PatchIt!** patch by entering the mod name, version, author, and description, and point it to the modded files. Automatically compress the files 
into a normal ZIP archive, and write the details to a plain text patch file (.PiP), using the name and version for the filenames.
* Install a **PatchIt!** patch by selecting the .PiP file, confirm the installation, and automatically decompress the ZIP archive directly into the *LEGO 
Racers* installation.
