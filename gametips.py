"\nOnly fire missiles when you have a clear shot at your opponents.\nOtherwise, you'll miss them completely.\n",
"\nDeveloping a good track line will improve your lap times.\nStay near corners to prevent a great speed loss when turning.\n",
"\nIs Veronica Voltage in your way? Just drive right through her,\nshe won't stop you.\n",
"\nTake your foot off the gas when you're hit by missiles or run into an oil slick:it will increase your chances of doing a full 360 degree spin,\ninstead of turning around backwards.\n"
