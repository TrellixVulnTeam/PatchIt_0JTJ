"Only fire missiles when you have a clear shot at your opponents. Otherwise, you'll miss them completely.",
"Developing a good track line will improve your lap times. Stay near corners to prevent a great speed loss when turning.",
"Is Veronica Voltage in your way? Just drive right through her, she won't stop you.",
"Take your foot off the gas when you're hit by missiles or run into an oil slick - it will increase your  chance of doing a full 360 degree spin, instead of turning around backwards."
