"\nHave you heard about the TRUCK DRIVER cheat code? It's fake.\nDon't believe anyone who tells you otherwise.\n",
"\nOnly fire missiles when you have a clear shot at your opponents.\nOtherwise, you'll miss them completely.\n",
"\nDeveloping a good track line will improve your lap times.\nStay near corners to prevent a great speed loss when turning.\n",
"\nIs Veronica Voltage in your way? Just drive right through her,\nshe won't stop you.\n",
"\nTake your foot off the gas when you're hit by missiles or run into an oil slick:it will increase your chances of doing a full 360 degree spin,\ninstead of turning around backwards.\n",
"\nListen to the console beeps in Magma Moon Marathon\nto learn the combination code to unlock the shortcut on the next lap.\n",
"\nFor a harder game experience, avoid using green bricks.\n",
