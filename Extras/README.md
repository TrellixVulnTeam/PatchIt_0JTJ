PatchIt! Extras
===============

**PatchIt!** Extras are simply optional downloads that make **PatchIt!** more enjoyable.

Why would you download a *LEGO Racers* mod installer and not have anything to install?  Answer: you wouldn't! So I've provided a few mod packs
to get you started. ![](http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?raw=true)

Texture Packs
-------------

### Nyan Cat-Athon

This mod, originally created by JimbobJeffers and with improvements by myself, reskins the Knightmare-Athon track to be [Nyan Cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4) themed. 
Complete with custom music of the Nyan Cat's theme song, this mod will be sure to either please your inner cat, or anger your inner dog.

### Royally Crafted Raceway
This interesting mod, created by Segatendo, reskins Royal Knights Raceway in Minecraft-style textures creating possibly the calmest mod available. 
Royally Crafted Raceway is so calm that it might even calm you down enough to win the race. :P
