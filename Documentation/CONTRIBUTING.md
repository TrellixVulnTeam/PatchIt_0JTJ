Contributing to PatchIt!
========================

If you would like to contribute to the development of **PatchIt!**, please be sure you meet the system requirements.

Requirements
------------

* As already stated, **PatchIt!** is written in Python 3, 3.3.0 to be exact. You will need to have a complete installation of Python `>=` 3.3 to edit and run 
*PatchIt!* Versions `<=` Python 2.7 is not supported, and a Python version check will prevent it from running on lower versions.

* No external packages or dependencies are needed for the ZIP archive functions, as it is implemented using native Python modules.
* Beta builds and the final release will be compiled into x86 and x64 Windows EXEs using [cx_freeze](http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net). [py2exe](
http://www.py2exe.org) does not support Python 3.3, so I cannot use it.

What To Do
-----------

* A (incomplete list) of everything that needs to be done can be found under [*TODO.md*](TODO.md).
 
* The .PiP format documentation can be found under in [*PiP File Format.md*](PiP%20File%20Format.md).

* The release goal of **PatchIt!** is to have a Beta 3 version ready for public use, although it may not completely bug free, while a proper GUI, written in Tkinter, will be released in Beta 4. Currently, there is no date set for any release. Of course, if everything is written and completed before then, it will be released as a final 1.0 version.
