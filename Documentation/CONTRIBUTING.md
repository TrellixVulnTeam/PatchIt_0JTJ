Contributing to PatchIt!
========================

If you would like to contribute to the development of **PatchIt!**, please be sure you meet the system requirements.

Requirements
------------

* As already stated, **PatchIt!** is written in Python 3, 3.3.0 to be exact. You will need to have a complete installation of Python `>=` 3.3 to edit and run 
*PatchIt!*. Versions `<=` Python 3.2 are not supported, and a Python version check will prevent it from running on lower versions.

* For all releases after **PatchIt! version 1.0.3 Stable**, you will need a complete copy of [*EasyGUI*](http://easygui.sourceforge.net/), which will be used for 
the Tkinter GUI.

* No external packages or dependencies are needed for the ZIP archive functions, as it is implemented using native Python modules.
* Beta builds and the final release will be compiled into x86 and x64 Windows EXEs using [cx_freeze](http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net). [py2exe](
http://www.py2exe.org) does not support Python 3.3, so I cannot use it.

Where to Start
---------------

* A (incomplete) of everything that needs to be done can be found under [*TODO.md*](TODO.md).
 
* The .PiP format documentation can be found under in [*PiP File Format.md*](PiP%20File%20Format.md).

* The release goals of *PatchIt!** is to write a complete Tkinter GUI for Version 1.1 Stable, as well any planned improvements. A release date has not been set, 
and will not be any time soon.
