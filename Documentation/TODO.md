TODO
====

[Issues](https://github.com/le717/PatchIt/issues) ususally contain the newest, up-to-date reports. This serves more as a long-term list.
* ~~**BUG** Sometimes Patch cannot be saved in a Dropbox folder~~ Cannot be fixed, due to nature of how Dropbox and related services work.
* Updated logo for **PatchIt!**, released along side GUI (hopefully to be created by [@rioforce](https://github.com/rioforce).
* *NEW!* Automatic LEGO.JAM extraction (upon user approval)
* *NEW!* Complete GUI, most likely using PyQt (postponed until later release)
* *NEW!* Cross-platform Compatibility (not until GUI, shell text colors are Windows-only)
* Any TODO items scattered around the scripts
