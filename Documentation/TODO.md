PatchIt! TODO List
==================

An (incomplete) list of everything that needs to be done in **PatchIt!**, listed in no particular order, as well as new, upcoming features and current bugs.

* ** MAJOR BUG** Thumbs.db is not deleted only in modded game files; instead, it is deleted in all surrounding folders. 
* **BUG** Why do some Shell Colors keep breaking?
* **BUG** Sometimes Patch cannot be saved in a Dropbox folder
* *NEW!* Modern PiP file creation code
* *NEW!* Automatic LEGO.JAM extraction (upon user approval)
* *NEW!* Expert LEGO Racers gameplay tips
* *NEW!* Complete Tkinter GUI (postponed until later release)
* *NEW!* Cross-platform Compatibility (not until GUI, shell colors are Windows-only)
* IDEA? *.PiP file shell registration. If user clicks a PiP file, it will automatically load **PatchIt** and run the Patch Installation module.
At first, could be added via the Inno Setup installer only, maybe later activated by command-line parameter, and finally a check in preload(), and 
a prompt to register it if not. Naturally, Windows-only.
* Get Windows version and OS bit upon load, save to log.
* Write Inno Setup Installer directions
* Write PiP Format V1.0.1 Revision History
* Any TODO items scattered around in any of the scripts
* LEGOs in Space? More later!
