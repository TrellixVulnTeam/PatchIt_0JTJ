PatchIt! TODO List
==================

An (incomplete) list of everything that needs to be done in **PatchIt!**. Is listed in no particular order.

* Ignore OSError and retain proper exit codes - **Currently impossible for me**
* Do not compress *.db or Desktop.ini into ZIP (avoid "Permission Denied" error)
* Add File Not Found error message
* App logging code
* Patch cannot be saved in a Dropbox folder
* Add new gameplay tips
* Complete TKinter GUI (V1.1 Stable release)
* Any TODO items scattered around in the scripts
* LEGOs in Space? More later!
